# Authentication and Image Uploading with Golang and HTMX

HTMX is a powerful tool that allows you to enhance web applications by leveraging HTML over the wire. Unlike traditional SPA frameworks that rely heavily on JavaScript, HTMX focuses on using server-rendered HTML and updating specific parts of the page dynamically.
